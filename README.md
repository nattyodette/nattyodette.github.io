    <body> The most important step of starting a journal is actually setting down the first entry. The notebook, the decoration, and the security are all just ways of making the journal feel like a safe space for you to write. Think about the sort of journal that you keep. </body>
    <li>Date your entry.</li>
    <body> For a slightly more involved record, write the time of day (morning, afternoon, night), your mood, and/or your location. Log the date at the top of the page or the top of each entry. </body>
    <li>Get into the flow of writing.</li>
    <body> The beauty of a journal is that you can tell the story that you don't usually tell people: the deep thoughts and feelings that lie behind your day-to-day decisions. Take the opportunity to explore yourself. </body>    
    <li> Think before you write.</li>
    <body> If you're having trouble finding your flow, try taking a few minutes to quietly reflect on what you're feeling. The act of writing can help you tease out these feelings. However, it can be hard to write until you have a clear idea of where to begin. </body>
    <li>Time Yourself.</li>
    <body> Try setting aside a discrete amount of time to write in your journal. Set a timer for 5 to 15 minutes, and then let yourself go. The "deadline" of the ticking clock may help motivate you to get writing. Don't worry about making it perfect! Simply write down everything that's on your mind. </body>
